----------------------

1.) Create a conda environment to install libraries in.  If unfamiliar with conda environments, see https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html


2.) Make sure the following python libraries are installed in your newly created environment.  For those unfamiliar with python, your choices are to either install libraries using pip or conda.  I recommned using conda.

	- TensorFlow
	- numpy
	- scipy
	- matplotlib
	- gym
	- cv2
	- IPython

3.) Each of our algorithms uses a seperate driver script
	-For multi-layer q-learning, run q_learning_uav.py
	-For DDPG, run ddpg_uav.py
	-For DQN, run
